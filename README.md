# PHPBB3_Crawler_Pro_Silver_Theme

PHP BB3 Crawler for style "prosilver" Just some code I quickly did in order to crawl a web forum in PHPBB3. It uses scrapy, partially, in order to do its job.

v1.0 - Basic crawling of forums, topics, posts and respective database commits. Customize it on crawler_settings.conf

Next releases:

v1.1 - Randomize the time of the day when the crawler should pause and resume

Syntax: scrapy crawl
